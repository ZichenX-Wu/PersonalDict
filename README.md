# PersonalDict
This is a tool for memorizing Words.

## Features

1. Support word search
2. Support word morphing search (synonyms, antonyms, deformations, equivalent forms)
3. Support partial search
4. Support word list view
5. Support Add new words to the Dict
6. Support phrase list view

## To be Fixed

1. word morphing search (How to deal with different words with the same deformation?) 
2. Split word morphing search of Translation

（Fixed）: 
1. Support '/' in sentences
2. Support '(' and ')' in deformations

## Future Plan

1. Modify exist word (word itself, word's attributes)
2. Search word by Translation(word morphing search ---> extension: partial search)
3. Use json to replace some init parameters.
4. Plan supports fuzzy search
5. Apply Dict to the Visual Application or WebServer
